Vulnerability of the Day
========================

Vulnerability of the Day is a pedagogically-curated collection of vulnerability demonstrations for undergraduate software engineering students. The goal is to teach students how to avoid simple coding mistakes by providing concise code examples.  Key characteristics are: 
* 10 minutes long or less
* Can be understood by a third-year college student in a software engineering course
* Socially-relevant examples
* Can be run on a Linux console, using make
* Simple, concise, but also not contrived. 
* Real-world CVEs (with source code patches linked) are a big plus

Source Code Formatting
======================

TBD

Layout
======

	www/ - webpage descriptions of each vulnerability. See the www/Readme.markdown for more details
	demos/ - code examples for each 
	instructors/ - notes for instructors in each vulnerability  
	
Building an Individual VotD
===========================

Details are TBD, but here's what I'm thinking. Sometimes a prof might want to just demo one VotD to the class. So they might do something like:  
 

```	
make integer-overflow
```
and it:
* Copies the code sample
* Makes an individual webpage for that VotD
* Optionally copies the instructor notes
