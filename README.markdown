Vulnerability of the Day
========================

Vulnerability of the Day is a pedagogically-curated collection of vulnerability demonstrations for undergraduate software engineering students. The goal is to teach students how to avoid simple coding mistakes by providing concise code examples.  Key characteristics are: 
* 10 minutes long or less
* Can be understood by a third-year college student in a software engineering course
* Socially-relevant examples
* Can be run on a Linux console, using make
* Simple, concise, but also not contrived. 
* Real-world CVEs (with source code patches linked) are a big plus
