Vulnerability of the Day
========================

Vulnerability of the Day is a pedagogically-curated collection of vulnerability demonstrations for undergraduate software engineering students. The goal is to teach students how to avoid simple coding mistakes by providing concise code examples.  Key characteristics are: 
* 10 minutes long or less
* Can be understood by a third-year college student in a software engineering course
* Socially-relevant examples
* Can be run on a Linux console, using make
* Simple, concise, but also not contrived. 
* Real-world CVEs (with source code patches linked) are a big plus

Code Formatting Guidelines
======================

TBD

Building Demos
==============

Each VotD must have a Makefile that can run on Linux, with the following targets `make`, `make exploit`, and `make compile`. The default is `make exploit`. Here's a skeleton  `Makefile`:

    # Sample Makefile for VotD
   
    exploit: compile
    	java BankAccount
    	java GetPatient

    compile: 
    	javac *.java

The one exception are web-based vulnerabilities (e.g. XSS), which require different building guidelines (TBD) 

Layout
======

    a-votd-dir/
	    www/ - webpage descriptions of each vulnerability. See the www/Readme.markdown for more details
	    demos/ - code examples for each vulnerabilitiy 
	    instructors/ - notes for instructors in each vulnerability  
	
Building an Individual VotD
===========================

Details are TBD, but here's what I'm thinking. Sometimes a prof might want to just demo one VotD to the class. So they might do something like:  

    make integer-overflow

and it:
* Copies the code sample 
* Makes an individual webpage for that VotD
* Optionally copies the instructor notes
* Zips it up and the webpage links to the zip

Or, maybe:

    make votds.txt

and it reads the text file for the votds, builds the webpage, and copies instructor notes for each day.

And, maybe:

    make new a-new-votd
    
and that makes a new set of directories for a votd
