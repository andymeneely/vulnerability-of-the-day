# Despite it being trivial in implementation and exploit, this one comes up a lot...
#
# Don't hardcode passwords!
#
# Even with obfuscation, you can always reverse engineer hardcoded keys. i
# Reversing takes some skill, and a lot of time, but crowds have both of those.
#
# While this example looks for "sesquipedalian", you can also use a reverse
# engineering tool to determine any hardcoded strings, and try those as passwords

exploit:
	javac Secret.java
	@echo "\n****** Grep for the secret ******"
	grep "sesquipedalian" Secret.class
	@echo "\n****** Disassemble *******"
	javap -c Secret
