# A trivial script that just delegates the input to the OS 

print "What files should I list? "
line = gets

# A user could escape the delimiter by including a ; in the input
# e.g. ruby list.rb *; echo "Hello!";
# system("ls -lah #{line}")

# A more secure way to do this is to only allow one command:
system("ls","-lah","#{line.chomp}")

# This is has one disadvantage that * is no longer supported, since that's
# a shell directive. But, it's still workable.
#
# But realistically, try to avoid these kinds of calls as often as possible
# APIs are easier to secure
