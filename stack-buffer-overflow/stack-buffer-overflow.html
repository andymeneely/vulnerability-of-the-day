<h2>Buffer Overflow</h2>
<p>
	<b>Description. </b> See <a
		href="http://cwe.mitre.org/top25/index.html#CWE-120">CWE-120</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Example:</b> <a href="buffer-overflow.zip">buffer-overflow.zip</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mitigations:</b> Keep track of your array sizes. Check the size of
	your buffer as it is inputted. In the case of C, use functions like
	<code>strncpy()</code>
	instead of
	<code>strcpy()</code>
	. Avoid functions like
	<code>gets</code>
	that don't check the input size.
</p>

	<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Buffer overflows have been very common for a long time</li>
	<li>If you are clever enough, you can override the return pointer
		on the stack frame so that your own code is then executed.</li>
	<li>Languages that enforce array lengths are not susceptible to
		this classic form (e.g. Java)</li>
	<li>Merely turning on the stack protector is not enough. We could
		easily craft an exploit that stays within the stack frame.</li>
</ul>
